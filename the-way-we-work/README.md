# The way we work

It is important for team members to know what they should be working on first. It is even better if they can decide as a team the importance of each task.

Here is a sensible default of such a ranking:

## We will work in the following order

1. Broken build
2. Code review
3. Test (if you do manual testing)
4. Bug
5. Story
